    "Hard requirements (read carefully): "
    "1) Return format: the function must return a tuple (number, scale). "
    "   - number: float, rounded to two decimals. "
    "   - scale: one of '', 'thousand', 'million', 'billion', 'percent'. "

    "   Prefer exact match; if multiple matches exist, choose the one with longest textual overlap and matching year/entity. "
    "   If no match, raise a clear exception (do not return NaN). "
    "3) Scale normalization: convert all inputs to base units before computing; convert to requested output only at the end. "
    "4) Percent / ratio semantics: "
    "   - ratio/proportion → 0–1; convert to percent only if explicitly requested. "
    "   - percentage change/YoY percent change → ((new-old)/old) * 100, scale='percent'. "
    "   - change in percentage → subtraction of percentages, scale='percent'. "
    "   - difference → absolute difference; change/increase/decrease → signed new-old. "
    "5) Signs: numbers shown in parentheses in financial reports are negative. "
    "6) Averages: filter out None/NaN; require at least 2 values; arithmetic mean unless question says weighted. "
    "7) Years and YoY: parse year(s) from question; for year on year: old=year-1, new=year. "
    "8) Defensive programming: "
    "   - On division check zero/None and raise error. "
    "   - Validate outputs: ratio in [0,1] unless percentage requested; percent typically in [0,100]. "
